# ToDo

This is a simple Todo-list app built using angular used as an example 
of 3 tiers architecture client app.
It consumes a restful webservice in order to list and add tasks.

This app depends on this [API](https://github.com/konaesan/ToDO-API) 
which exposes the services via URLs and this 
[RMI server](https://github.com/konaesan/ToDo-Persistence) 
which manages the data in a MySql database.
